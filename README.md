# Welcome!

Hello, I'm **Invra**! I have a passion for **Computer Science**, particularly in **Programming** and **Network Engineering**.

## My Domains

### Nix

I use the Nix ecosystem and have become fairly proficient with the Nix language. Since early 2025, Iâ€™ve been confident in my ability to write minimal flakes for the software I use.

### Web

Iâ€™ve been doing web development to cure boredom since 2022. I mostly stick with a React-based framework, primarily Next.js nowadays. Iâ€™m also familiar with Vanilla and Tailwind CSS.
No, I donâ€™t know Bulma or Bootstrap *yet*.

### Linux

Iâ€™ve been using Linux since around 2020 or 2021. I started with Manjaro (a questionable Arch-based distro), moved on to Arch Linux, and later to EndeavourOS. Since January 2025, Iâ€™ve happily settled on NixOS.
I gained a solid understanding of Arch over the years, mostly in the art of fixing a broken system â€” something Arch users know all too well. From 2022 to 2024, I used vanilla Arch daily, with a brief detour through EndeavourOS when I didnâ€™t feel like setting up Arch manually.

### macOS (formerly OS X)

This was the first OS I ever used. Iâ€™ve been using it since I was 5, around 2014. Starting with Yosemite, I stuck with macOS through to Mojave â€” Apple was back in black, but so were the fumes coming out of the laptop from the heat.
Iâ€™ve had some experience with Catalina and Big Sur, but eventually moved to Linux and grew to dislike macOS.
Or did I? Iâ€™m currently typing this on a machine running macOS Tahoe.

### Windows

I know my way around Windows internally, but using it practically is more of a chore than Linux or macOS.
Despite its 80% market share, it often feels like it barely works â€” laggy UI, `explorer.exe` crashes, and arguably the worst developer experience.
Remember when that one guy at Microsoft kept saying "developers"? Too bad his board members didnâ€™t hear him.

### BSD

Barely know anything about this yet. ðŸ™‚
